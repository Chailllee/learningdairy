## Abstract

Here is the overview of remote sensing techniques for classifying and assessing the accuracy of land cover data. Here are the key points:

-   **Landcover Classification**: It discusses the use of pre-classified data sources like GlobeLand30, ESA’s CCI, Dynamic World, MODIS, and Google building data for landcover classification.

-   **Dynamic World**: The page details the process of training, pre-processing, normalization, and classification using CNNs, with a focus on Dynamic World’s semi-supervised approach and regional division for sample stratification.

-   **Sub Pixel Analysis**: It explains the concept of sub pixel classification, spectral mixture analysis, and linear spectral unmixing, including mathematical formulas for calculating the proportion of landcover per pixel.

-   **Accuracy Assessment**: The page outlines various accuracy assessment methods in remote sensing, such as producer’s accuracy, user’s accuracy, overall accuracy, and the Kappa coefficient, along with their definitions and significance.

## Reflection

This reminds me of my undergraduate dissertation project, where I evaluated the accuracy of fire detection models using confusion matrices.

**Firstly**, I prepared the data by creating binary classification labels using both active detection thresholding and visual inspection methods as ground truth data. **Next**, I trained the model using a U-net neural network model on remote sensing images, applying both cross-entropy and focal loss functions. **Finally**, I made predictions and evaluations by [predicting fire pixel locations]{.underline} in new images and [assessing the differences between expected and original images]{.underline} [using confusion matrix]{.underline} evaluation metrics to determine prediction accuracy. Evaluating accuracy was a crucial practical experience for me in using convolutional networks to predict fire spots in remote sensing images.
