# About me {.unnumbered}

Hello, my name is Xiaoyi Chen. I developed a keen interest in remote sensing during my undergraduate studies due to my involvement in a graduation project focused on remote sensing image processing. This experience sparked my curiosity and enthusiasm for exploring the intricacies of this field further.

Additionally, I have a passion for photography and enjoy capturing moments through my lens. Below are some of my photographic records.
